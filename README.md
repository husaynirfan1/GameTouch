Simple java touch games developed using Android Studio. Written in Java.

## Gameplay:

The game screen displays a grid of colored squares.
At the beginning of each level, a timer starts counting down.
Players tap on squares as fast as possible to make them disappear.
Each tap registers a point.

* Level 1: Starts with a small grid (e.g., 3x3) and a slow timer (e.g., 10 seconds).
* Level 2: Increases grid size (e.g., 4x4) and slightly reduces timer duration (e.g., 8 seconds).
* Level 3: Further increases grid size (e.g., 5x4) and reduces timer duration (e.g., 6 seconds).
* Level 4: Largest grid size (e.g., 5x5) and fastest timer (e.g., 4 seconds).
* Level 5: Even faster timer (e.g., 3 seconds) with the same grid size as Level 4.
  
## Win Condition:

The level ends when the timer runs out.
Players see their total number of taps achieved in that level.
They can then proceed to the next level.
